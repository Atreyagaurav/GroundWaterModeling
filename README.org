* Groundwater Simulations Using Flopy

** Introduction

[[https://github.com/modflowpy/flopy][Flopy]] is a python library which can interact with [[https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model][MODFLOW]] program for you. It can be used to make the models, the files and to do the postprocessing of the results from modeflow output.

In this repo there are 4 models written in python that does different things in flopy all involving some groundwater simulation scenarios, and are in increasing order of difficulties.
